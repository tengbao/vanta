## What is Vanta? / FAQs

- **Add 3D animated digital art to any webpage with just a few lines of code.**
- How it works: Vanta inserts an animated effect as a background into any HTML element.
- Works with vanilla JS, React, Angular, Vue, etc.
- Effects are rendered by [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) (using WebGL) or [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js).
- Effects can interact with mouse/touch inputs.
- Effect parameters (e.g. color) can be easily modified to match your brand.
- Total additional file size is ~120kb minified and gzipped (mostly three.js), which is smaller than comparable background images/videos.
- Vanta includes many predefined effects to try out. *More effects will be added soon!*

## Basic usage with script tags:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r121/three.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanta@0.5.21/dist/vanta.waves.min.js"></script>
<script>
  VANTA.WAVES('#my-background')
</script>
```

## More options:

```js
VANTA.WAVES({
  el: '#my-background', // element selector string or DOM object reference
  color: 0x000000,
  waveHeight: 20,
  shininess: 50,
  waveSpeed: 1.5,
  zoom: 0.75
})
```

- **el:** The container element.
  - The Vanta canvas will be appended as a child of this element, and will assume the width and height of this element. (If you want a fullscreen canvas, make sure this container element is fullscreen.)
  - This container *can* have other children. The other children will appear as foreground content, in front of the Vanta canvas.

- **mouseControls:** (defaults to *true*) Set to false to disable mouse controls. Only applies to certain effects.

- **touchControls:** (defaults to *true*) Set to false to disable touch controls. Only applies to certain effects.

- **gyroControls:** (defaults to *false*) Set to true to allow gyroscope to imitate mouse. Only applies to certain effects.

- **NOTE:** Each effect has its own specific parameters. Explore them all at www.vantajs.com!

## Updating options after init:

```js
const effect = VANTA.WAVES({
  el: '#my-background',
  color: 0x000000
})

// Later, when you want to update an animation in progress with new options
effect.setOptions({
  color: 0xff88cc
})

// Later, if the container changes size and you want to force Vanta to redraw at the new canvas size
effect.resize()
```

## Cleanup:

```js
const effect = VANTA.WAVES('#my-background')
effect.destroy() // e.g. call this in React's componentWillUnmount
```

## Usage with React (hooks):

`npm i vanta`, then import a specific effect as follows. Make sure `three.js` or `p5.js` has already been included via &lt;script> tag.

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
import BIRDS from 'vanta/dist/vanta.birds.min'
// Make sure window.THREE is defined, e.g. by including three.min.js in the document head using a <script> tag

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  const [vantaEffect, setVantaEffect] = useState(0)
  const vantaRef = useRef(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!vantaEffect) {
      setVantaEffect(BIRDS({
        el: vantaRef.current
      }))
    }
    return () => {
      if (vantaEffect) vantaEffect.destroy()
    }
  }, [vantaEffect])
  return <div ref={vantaRef}>
    Foreground content goes here
  </div>
}
```

## Usage with React class components:

```js
import React from 'react'
import BIRDS from 'vanta/dist/vanta.birds.min'
// Make sure window.THREE is defined, e.g. by including three.min.js in the document head using a <script> tag

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.vantaRef = React.createRef()
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.vantaEffect = BIRDS({
      el: this.vantaRef.current
    })
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.vantaEffect) this.vantaEffect.destroy()
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.vantaRef}>
      Foreground content goes here
    </div>
  }
}
```

## Usage with Vue 2 (SFC):

```vue
<template>
  <div ref='vantaRef'>
    Foreground content here
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import BIRDS from 'vanta/src/vanta.birds'
// Make sure window.THREE is defined, e.g. by including three.min.js in the document head using a <script> tag

export default {
  mounted() {
    this.vantaEffect = BIRDS({
      el: this.$refs.vantaRef
    })
  },
  beforeDestroy() {
    if (this.vantaEffect) {
      this.vantaEffect.destroy()
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Using THREE or p5 from npm

For effects that use three.js, you can import `three` from npm, and pass it into the effect function.

```js
import React from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'
import BIRDS from 'vanta/dist/vanta.birds.min'

...
  componentDidMount() {
    this.vantaEffect = BIRDS({
      el: this.vantaRef.current,
      THREE: THREE // use a custom THREE when initializing
    })
  }
...
```

For effects that use p5.js, you can import `p5` from npm, and pass it into the effect function.

```js
import React from 'react'
import p5 from 'p5'
import TRUNK from 'vanta/dist/vanta.trunk.min'

...
  componentDidMount() {
    this.vantaEffect = TRUNK({
      el: this.vantaRef.current,
      p5: p5 // use a custom p5 when initializing
    })
  }
...
```
